# Born in a Barn #

## History ##

Born in a Barn is a modern version of the nativity story in verse. It
aims to be snappy and humorous, whilst remaining true to the original.

I wrote the first version of the script in September 2019, for the
Longridge Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade, where I volunteer.

It was performed with great enthusiasm (thanks to the young Brigade
members) and some technical hiccups (all my fault) at St. Paul's
Church in Longridge (Lancashire, UK) on 15 December 2019.

This is a lightly-edited version of the original, converted into a
variety of ebook formats, in case any other youth groups or schools
are interested in using it.

## Notes for readers and performers ##

Ready-to-use versions of the script are available to download from the
`ebooks` folder in this repository.

These are suitable for printing on A4 or US Letter sized paper, or
viewable on screen using your preferred ebook reader.

## Technical notes on building the ebooks ##

The script text formatted using the Pandoc version of Markdown,
resides in the `text` folder.

Cover art was created using the [Gnu Image Manipulation
Program][Gimp]. It can be found in the `art` folder. The barn was
photographed by the author in the Teesdale area of England in April
2019.

The [Pandoc universal document converter][Pandoc] was used to create
the epub version.

Conversion to mobi, azw3, and pdf formats was achieved using [Calibre
ebook management][Calibre].

There is a dependency on [TeX Live] to create the pdfs.

A GNU Makefile to build the books can be found in the `scripts`
folder.
